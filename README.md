### Notes
Transpiling is done with Babel so that modern JavaScript is understood in all browsers.
Don't need the compiling middle manager before pushing the code out.

JavaScript is moving towards functional programming, making it more modular.

Optional chaining - check if variable exists before making a request; removes the chunks of if statements, making the code set cleaner.

JSX will automatically work with Babel, natively supported, without imports.
