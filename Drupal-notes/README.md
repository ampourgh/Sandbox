Blocks discussion

**MODULES**

Enabling a module (i.e., the forum module):

If you look into permissions, if you go into F, you wont find the forum module since it hasn't been enabled yet.

Extend > Install a New Module

Search for the forum module and enable it.

Forum module will say that it isn't required for any existing item on the drupal page; therefore it would be an add-on.


How do you select a module?

Development releases are color coded in green, yellow and red. Green is good for use, yellow is usable but has not been tested, and red has issues that need to be resolved and is not good for use in a production environment.
